## I know my code is bad

- That is why this repo exists

## Cloning the project \(if you want to for some reason\)

To clone the project you can use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PerryLets/learning-c.git
```

### Setup for .vscode/tasks.json \(Linux and MacOS\)

For the VS Code tasks to work, you need to create two folders.

- bin
- bin/debug

To do so, run the following commands on your terminal:

```bash
cd learning-cpp
mkdir bin
mkdir bin/debug
```

You also need to change the tasks to use your preferred compiler.

### Setup for .vscode\\tasks.json \(Windows\)

For the VS Code tasks to work, you need to create two folders.

- bin
- bin\\debug

To do so, run the following commands on your terminal:

```cmd
cd learning-cpp
mkdir bin
mkdir bin\debug
```

You will also need a compiler, which usually isn't included on a Windows machine.
You can install gcc on [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). After you have the compiler, you can change the tasks to use it.
